Description:
Our art project is a clicker game. The goal is to rack up as many eggs (points) as possible with no time limit. To get eggs, you click the chicken that
randomly goes around the screen after every click. Every click grants you one egg, but if you click the "upgrade button" you get one more egg per click.
Clicking the "upgrade button" will deduct the amount of eggs you have, and the cost will increase exponentially as you keep using it.
